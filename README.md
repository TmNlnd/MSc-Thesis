# MSc Thesis

This repository contains the code that was applied in the process of writing my Msc Thesis in Business Information Management.

## Description

The purpose of this research is to contribute to the current body of knowledge on the application of convolutional neural networks in the field of stock market index prediction.

## The repository contains the following folders:
1. 2D-Models
2. 82 Features
3. 92 Features
4. Construction Technical Indicators
5. Dataset
6. Descriptive Statistics


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Any application that handles Python.
* For this study I used Spyder.

### Installing

* I recommend to download all folders. Otherwise, code snippets can be run individually.
* No modifications are needed to the files/folders. The code can run with the current set up.

### Executing Code

* Set the correct working directory.
* To test the Models using 82 features, use the code in the 82 Features folder.
* To test the Models using 92 features, use the code in the 92 Features folder.
* Load the needed libraries and packages.
* Select the entire code belonging to one model.
* Run the code till after the following code block
```
# Run the CNN2pred-model
run_cnn(data_warehouse, order_stocks)
```
